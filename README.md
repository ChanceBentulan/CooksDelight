# CooksDelight


A school project from our mobile development class this is an IOS mobile application. We used objective C in building this application. 

It makes the user input their own recipe then it will be saved on the recipe list. Then the user can check for available ingredients in their recipe. For the ingredients that has not been checked it will be added to a grocery list. It makes the life of a cook much more convenient
